# About me
 
Former Valuations Service Delivery Manager at a large investment bank, providing services to UK-domiciled OEICs and Unit Trusts.

I've been learning programming on my own and have NEVER participated in any bootcamp.

I respect my privacy, hence you wonâ€™t find me on LinkedIn or other social media platforms.
